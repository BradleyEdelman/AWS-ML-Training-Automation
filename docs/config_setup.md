# Config File (`config.yaml`) Setup Guide 

This guide explains the **configuration settings** in `config.yaml`, which controls the AWS ML training automation process.  

**Why use `config.yaml`?**  
- Keeps **user settings separate** from automation scripts.  
- Allows easy customization of **AWS resources, model training, and storage settings**.  
- Ensures that users **do not have to modify scripts manually**.

  s3_bucket: "your-bucket-name"
